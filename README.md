## I’m Abi 👋✨

I’m a **software developer** who loves 💗 to **build cool things** and experiment with a variety of **fun technologies**! From developing **games** 🎮 to exploring the wonders of **Web3** 🌐, I’m driven by the joy of **learning, creating, and having fun**. If it’s about making something **fast**, **beautiful**, and **interactive**, count me in! ⚡💻

I spend my time coding in languages like **C++** 🖋️, **Java** ☕, and **TypeScript** 🌐, while recently diving deeper into the world of **Rust** 🦀. I’ve built everything from **action games** ⚔️ to a **peer-to-peer chat app** 💬 and even a small **NFT marketplace** 🎨. My favorite projects involve creating **performant applications** that push the boundaries of what’s possible, while keeping things looking **smooth** and **stylish**. 🎨✨

### 🛠️ What I’ve Been Up To

Some of my proudest creations include:

- A **full-stack social media platform** 🌟 using **Kotlin Springboot** and **Next.js 13**, blending modern frontend design with robust backend logic.
- A series of **2D game engines** 🕹️ built in **C++**, demonstrating low-level programming and creative design.
- A **local Rust-based chat application** 🔗 leveraging **libp2p** for decentralized communication.
- An **NFT marketplace** 🖼️ built on **Ethereum** using **Solidity**, tapping into the potential of **Web3**.

Even though many of these projects are small or experimental, I cherish each one because they’re a testament to my **curiosity** and love ❤️ for the craft. 🚀

### 🔮 What’s Next?

Right now, I’m exploring the fields of **AI** 🤖 and **Web3** 🔗 to create the next generation of digital experiences. I want to build apps that are not only **performant** and **interactive** 🎉 but also **decentralized** and **intelligent**.

So, welcome to my world! 🌍 I’m always excited to connect with fellow devs, creators, and tech enthusiasts. 🤗💜 Let’s create something amazing together! 🚀✨
